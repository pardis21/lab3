## Lab 3

Authors : Sriram Alagappan, Fanny Buonomo 

Part1 is populating the list, and testing different scenarios (step 1-3)

Part2 is using a global lock to check linearization points (step 4-7)

Part3 is merging the thread local histories after the execution (step 8-9)

Part4 is merging the thread local histories during execution with producer consumer (step 10-11).

Each part has a makefile : `make` to compile, `make run` to run the code.
